Web scrappers bots (Node.js and Puppeteer) 

-  An intagram bot which can download posts from reddit and post to your instagram account
-  An instagram follower bot which can go to followers list of other accounts and follow people
-  A Tinder bot which login performs facebook login and randomly swipe left and right

Only good use case I could come up for my raspberry pi. lol.

module.exports = {
    username: "usrname",
    password: "pass"
}
