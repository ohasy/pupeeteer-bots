Only good use case I could come up for my raspberry pi. 

// make a cred.js
module.exports = {
    username: "usrname",
    password: "pass"
}


cron jobs
// -> download stuff with cron job.
// -> upload stuff with long delays.
// -> download more images

run :
npm install --global pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 startup
